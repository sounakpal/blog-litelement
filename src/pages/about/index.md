### Closing the gap with Native Elements

We don't need any JavaScript framework to use Web Components. All the parts of the Web Components specifications like custom elements v1, templates, slots, and ShadowDOM work well in the browser. This means there is no dependency wrangling to start coding Web Components.

You don't need a ton of JavaScript just to render UI. Web Components are beneficial for instances where loading heavy dependencies prohibits user interaction, like in the case of rendering on a mobile.

### A lot of ideas drive from JavaScript

**It’s straight-forward and simple.** LitElement stays as close as it can to standard JavaScript and HTML. On the HTML side, there are minimal proprietary attributes, tags, etc. so that your finished HTML looks… well, normal. On the JavaScript side, the components you build follow the syntax and format of standard ES6 modules.

### Library for tomorrow

**Now that the web standards are defined, the API allows all standard APIs mentioned in [specifications](https://spec.whatwg.org/) with polyfill. We have seen how the polymer team has been developing its backward compatible tools. That's how we know we're good for tomorrow.**
