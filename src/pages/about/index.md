### Closing the gap with Native elements 

We don't need no JavaScript framework to use Web Components. The parts of the Web Components spec custom elements v1, templates, slots, and ShadowDOM all work in the browser. This means no dependency wrangling to start coding Web Components

You don't need a ton of JavaScript just to render UI. Web Components are beneficial for instances where loading heavy dependencies prohibits user interaction, like in the case of mobile.

### Lot of ideas drive from JavaScript

**It’s straight-forward and simple.** LitElement stays as close as it can to standard JavaScript and HTML. On the HTML side, there are minimal proprietary attributes, tags, etc. so that your finished HTML looks… well, normal. On the JavaScript side, the components you build follow the syntax and format of standard ES6 modules.

### Library for tomorrow

**We have seen how polymer team have been developing their backward compatible tools. Now that the web standards are defined the api allows all standard apis mentioned in [spec](https://spec.whatwg.org/) with polyfill.**
